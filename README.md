# Film Club Knowledge Graph

Core FilmClub knowledge graph assets.

## Contents
- `movieontology.ttl` — core ontology for the FilmClub KG
- `oscar_nominated_movies.ttl` — reference dataset of Oscar-nominated movies
- `fckg_demo_best_picture.ipynb` — demo notebook that queries the ontology and reference data, then trains a model to predict Best Picture

## Notes
- This repo is intended to be the canonical home for KG reference assets.
- Downstream projects (e.g., FilmClub) can consume these files as a submodule or by syncing releases.
